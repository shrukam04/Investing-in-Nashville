This real estate company is looking to make an investment into the growing Nashville area. Theyâ€™ve acquired a dataset about recent sales and want you to build a model to help them accurately find the best value deals when they go to visit next week. The dataset has 23542 rows and 18 columns and parameters like Land Use, Sale Price, Sold As Vacant, Multiple Parcels Involved in Sale, Address, Acreage, Land Value, Building Value, Total Value, Finished Area, Year Built, Exterior Wall, Grade, Bedrooms, Full Bath, Half Bath to predict the prices of houses.
